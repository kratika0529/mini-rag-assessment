# Mini RAG: AI Research Assistant 📚

A production-style Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that delivers accurate, grounded answers with citations from custom datasets.  
This project demonstrates an end-to-end AI engineering pipeline including document ingestion, vector search, reranking, and LLM-based answer generation.

Built as part of the Generative AI Engineer Assessment (Track B – Mini RAG).

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to design and deploy a small but complete RAG system where:

1. Users provide text or documents
2. Content is embedded and stored in a cloud-hosted vector database
3. Relevant chunks are retrieved and reranked
4. A Large Language Model generates a grounded answer
5. All responses include inline citations mapped to source chunks

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a Retrieve → Rerank → Generate pipeline to ensure that only the most relevant context is provided to the LLM.

  ## 📊 Minimal Evaluation (Gold Set)
Tested using the IIT Mandidataset to verify retrieval precision and refusal logic.

| Query | Expected Fact | Result | Citation Correct? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "When was IIT Mandi established?" | 2009 | ✅ Pass | ✅ Yes [1] |
| "What are the two main campuses?" | North and South Campus | ✅ Pass | ✅ Yes [1, 2] |
| "Who was the founding director?" | Timothy A. Gonsalves | ✅ Pass | ✅ Yes [1] |
| "What river flows near the campus?" | Uhl River | ✅ Pass | ✅ Yes [2] |
| "Does the campus have a metro station?" | Not mentioned in text | ✅ Pass (Correct Refusal) | N/A |
